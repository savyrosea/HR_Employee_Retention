# HR_Employee_Retention

### Data
###### Data is from https://www.kaggle.com/giripujar/hr-analytics. This dataset contains variables that describe employees at a company as well as a variable "left" that indicates whether or not the employee was retained the following work year.

### Project
##### For this project I am trying to predict employee retention based on employee data such as salary, number of hours worked, evaluation score etc.
##### My goal is to solve this classification problem two ways : with Logistic Regression and with Random Forest. I want to compare the scores of each model and come to a conclusion about which method is the best to use for this particular problem.

### Cleaning
##### This data is from Kaggle and therefore did not require mcuh initial cleaning. After I renamed some columns, and preformed EDA. I created dummy columns from the categorical salary data to use in my logistic regressiona nd random forest.
