# HR_Employee_Retention

### Data
###### Data is from https://www.kaggle.com/giripujar/hr-analytics.

### Project
##### For this project I am trying to predict employee retention based on employee data such as salary, number of hours worked, evaluation score etc.
##### My goal is to solve this classification problem two ways : with Logistic Regression and with Random Forest. I want to compare the scores of each model and come to a conclusion about which method is the best to use for this particular problem.
